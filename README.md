# Spam-filter-for-new-messages
I made a Spam filter for new messages which categorizes new messages as either Spam or Not-spam. The filter uses Naive Bayes algorithm to classify messages.

We use a dataset of more than 5000 messages which were already classified by humans as spam or not-spam. We use 80% of the data to calculate P(w|spam) while using the remaining 20% data to test the accuracy of the algorithm.
